The F1 score, recall score, and precision score are all performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models.
While accuracy is a commonly used metric, it can be misleading in cases where the classes are imbalanced. For example,
if 95% of the samples belong to class A and only 5% belong to class B,
a model that always predicts class A will have a 95% accuracy, but it will fail to correctly identify any samples from class B.
